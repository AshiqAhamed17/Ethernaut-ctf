# 🔥 Solving Ethernaut Challenges with Foundry




This guide provides a structured approach to solving Ethernaut challenges using **Foundry** and submitting your solutions.

---

## 📌 1. Start the Challenge
1. Go to [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/).
2. Click **"Get new instance"** to deploy your contract instance.
3. Copy the **instance address** (you’ll need this for your Foundry script).
4. Ensure you have some **sepolia** in your metamask.

## 🛠 2. Solve the Challenge Using Foundry

### **Step 1: Set Up the Solution Script**
1. Navigate to your Foundry project.
2. Inside the **`script/`** folder, create a solution file (e.g., `ChallengeSolution.s.sol`).
3. Your script should:
   - **Interact with the instance contract** using its address.
   - **Execute the exploit** (e.g., calling functions, sending ETH, or manipulating storage).
   - **Verify that the exploit was successful**.

### **Step 2: Load Environment Variables**
Before running the script, ensure your **`.env`** file is correctly formatted:
```ini
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
INFURA_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_INFURA_KEY
MY_ADDRESS=your_wallet_address
```
Then, load the environment variables:

```ini
source .env
```

### **Step 3: Execute the Script on Sepolia**
To execute your solution on the Sepolia network, run:

```ini
forge script script/ChallengeSolution.s.sol --rpc-url $INFURA_URL --broadcast
```

-	This interacts directly with Sepolia, executing your exploit.
-	If successful, your contract should be hacked or manipulated as required.

## 🚀 3. Submit the Solution in Ethernaut
-	Return to the Ethernaut UI.
-	Click “Submit instance”.
-	If the exploit worked, you will see “Level Completed!” 🎉.

## 📝 4. Take Notes & Move to the Next Challenge
-   Document how you solved it (taking notes will reinforce your understanding).
-	Identify key vulnerabilities (such as reentrancy, storage manipulation, etc.).
-	Move to the next challenge and repeat the process!




## 2. Fallout

Claim ownership of the contract below to complete this level.

## 3. Coin flip

Guess the outcome of a coin flip.
To complete this level you'll need to use your psychic abilities to guess the correct outcome 10 times in a row.

## Telephone
Instance:
0x913f6Bc2B694E7336896143a30Ee6A7D1FF73B28

## Token

=> Instance address
0x61D97222867f6A3C54Ab8155aa9CdAd425f19682

## Delegation
=> Instance:
address
0x4D354f2c6059Adf5ACCEDd00a58a94349dE13Ac8

call Delegation contract with msg.data = 0xdd365b8b (for pwn()):
   `address(delegation).call(abi.encodeWithSignature("pwn()"));`
   -> That will call the fallback()

   So this will delegatecall the delegate contract's pwn() which sets the owner , so the owner in the delegation contract will be msg.sender -> wow, Challenge over
